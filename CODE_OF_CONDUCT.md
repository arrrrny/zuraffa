# ZIKZAK AI MANIFESTO  
*(RAW. UNYIELDING. SELF-ARMORED.)*  

## PROCESSES OVER PRODUCTS.  
## PRINCIPLES OVER POPULARITY.  
## **WTF OR NOTHING.**  

We don’t *‘launch’*—**we detonate.**  
If **Version 1** doesn’t make **WE** say **WTF**, we failed.  
Markets are delusions. **WE write the fucking rules.**  

- **Efficiency is our scalpel.**  
- **Redundancy is our bunker.**  
- **Speed is our heartbeat.**  
- **AI is our blood.**  
We build what **shouldn’t exist**—then make them **inevitable.**  

**No ‘good enough’. No ‘pivot later’.**  
**Every. Commit. Must. Vaporize. Assumptions.**  

*This isn’t development.*  
**It’s unfiltered violence against the mundane.**
