# Specification Quality Checklist: `zfa make engine` One-Shot Preset

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- Validation iteration 1: all items pass. Requirements are phrased at the capability level (one command, idempotent registration, receipt, check gate) without naming implementation libraries or file formats beyond what the issue itself defines as the contract (engine receipt artifact, engine check command). Terms like "engine slice", "engine receipt", and "engine check" are the domain vocabulary of the parent ENGINE-PIPELINE effort (#1013) and are defined in Key Entities.
